    'bifrost-keystone-client-config' role can now write 'clouds.yaml' file
    with several clouds settings. It starts to accept a single compound
    variable 'clouds' that should contain a dict of
    '<cloud-name>:<dict-of-cloud-settings>'.
    Previous way of passing 'config_*' vars to the role is supported for
    backward compatibility but is deprecated.

    In addition to previous 'bifrost' cloud, the default 'install.yaml'
    playbook now also writes 'bifrost-admin' cloud settings that contain
    Keystone admin credentials so that when installed, the Keystone service
    is fully usable right away (users/projects etc can be managed).

deprecations:
  - |
    Passing 'config_*' variables defining credentials for 'bifrost'
    cloud to 'bifrost-keystone-client-config' role is deprecated.
    Instead a single compound variable named 'clouds' defining sets of
    settings to be written to 'clouds.yaml' should be passed to that role.
