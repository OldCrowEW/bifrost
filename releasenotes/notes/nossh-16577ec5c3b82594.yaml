    Bifrost starts to phase out support of SSH power and management drivers
    in ironic as these drivers are unsupported and targeted for removal
    from ironic in Pike release.

    Bifrost testing is moved to ``ipmitools``-based ironic drivers and
    virtual hardware exposed via 'virtualbmc' utility.

    Default ironic drivers set up by bifrost are changed to
    ``pxe_ipmitool`` and ``agent_ipmitool``.

    Default driver for CSV baremetal data files in bifrost's dynamic inventory
    is changed to ``agent_ipmitool``.

    ``bifrost-ironic-install`` role is decoupled from libvirt, and
    all preparation for testing with 'virtual' hardware are now handled in
    ``bifrost-create-vm-nodes`` role.

    Default driver for CSV baremetal data files in bifrost's dynamic inventory
    is changed to ``agent_ipmitool``.
    Those bifrost users relying on such behavior must explicitly set the
    driver in CSV baremetal data file.

    Handling of ``*_ssh`` drivers for CSV baremetal data format is
    deprecated and will be removed in Queens release.
